  - `Total Profit` → `Profit`  
- Applied a *Data Source Filter* to include only 2012 data for optimized performance.  
- Added filters for *Sales by Month, Sales by Type,* and *Sales by Country* to enhance interactivity.  
  - Selecting a specific *month*, *item type*, or *country* dynamically updates the *Sales* and *Profit* values, along with the other sheets in the dashboard.
